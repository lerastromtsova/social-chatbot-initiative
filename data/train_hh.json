Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge\u2019s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo\u2019s choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing.", "users": [{"userType": "Human", "id": "Alice"}, {"userType": "Human", "id": "Bob"}], "evaluation": [{"breadth": 3, "userId": "Alice", "quality": 3, "engagement": 3}, {"breadth": 3, "userId": "Bob", "quality": 3, "engagement": 3}], "thread": [{"evaluation": 2, "text": "Now, nintendo is a remnant of the past.", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 10, "NP_LEN": 4, "NLL": 41.19604696207356}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "Thou it was quite a tech company in its days", "userId": "Alice", "UTT_LEN": 10, "NP_LEN": 3, "NLL": 278.9410638424466}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "My statetment is only about game consoles.", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 8, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 555.9348184542611}], "dialogId": -1868945774}, {"context": "In 2002, Elizabeth marked her Golden Jubilee.

The physical properties, such as density, reactivity, Young's modulus of an alloy may not differ greatly from those of its elements, but engineering properties such as tensile strength and shear strength may be substantially different from those of the constituent materials. This is sometimes a result of the sizes of the atoms in the alloy, because larger atoms exert a compressive force on neighboring atoms, and smaller atoms exert a tensile force on their neighbors, helping the alloy resist deformation. Sometimes alloys may exhibit marked differences in behavior even when small amounts of one element are present. For example, impurities in semiconducting ferromagnetic alloys lead to different properties, as first predicted by White, Hogan, Suhl, Tian Abrie and Nakamura. Some alloys are made by melting and mixing two or more metals. Bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, was the first alloy discovered, during the prehistoric period now known as the bronze age; it was harder than pure copper and originally used to make tools and weapons, but was later superseded by metals and alloys with better properties.

The Society played a large role in spreading Robert Boyle's experimental philosophy around Europe, and acted as a clearinghouse for intellectual correspondence and exchange. Boyle was \"a founder of the experimental world in which scientists now live and operate,\" and his method based knowledge on experimentation, which had to be witnessed to provide proper empirical legitimacy.

The blank records for cutting used to be cooked up, as needed, by the cutting engineer, using what Robert K. Morrison describes as a \"metallic soap,\" containing lead litharge, ozokerite, barium sulfate, montan wax, stearin and paraffin, among other ingredients. Cut \"wax\" sound discs would be placed in a vacuum chamber and gold-sputtered to make them electrically conductive for use as mandrels in an electroforming bath, where pressing stamper parts were made. Later, the French company Pyral invented a ready-made blank disc having a thin nitro-cellulose lacquer coating (approximately 7 mils thickness on both sides) that was applied to an aluminum substrate. Lacquer cuts result in an immediately playable, or processable, master record. If vinyl pressings are wanted, the still-unplayed sound disc is used as a mandrel for electroforming nickel records that are used for manufacturing pressing stampers. The electroformed nickel records are mechanically separated from their respective mandrels. This is done with relative ease because no actual \"plating\" of the mandrel occurs in the type of electrodeposition known as electroforming, unlike with electroplating, in which the adhesion of the new phase of metal is chemical and relatively permanent. The one-molecule-thick coating of silver (that was sprayed onto the processed lacquer sound disc in order to make its surface electrically conductive) reverse-plates onto the nickel record's face. This negative impression disc (having ridges in place of grooves) is known as a nickel master, \"matrix\" or \"father.\" The \"father\" is then used as a mandrel to electroform a positive disc known as a \"mother\". Many mothers can be grown on a single \"father\" before ridges deteriorate beyond effective use. The \"mothers\" are then used as mandrels for electroforming more negative discs known as \"sons\". Each \"mother\" can be used to make many \"sons\" before deteriorating. The \"sons\" are then converted into \"stampers\" by center-punching a spindle hole (which was lost from the lacquer sound disc during initial electroforming of the \"father\"), and by custom-forming the target pressing profile. This allows them to be placed in the dies of the target (make and model) record press and, by center-roughing, to facilitate the adhesion of the label, which gets stuck onto the vinyl pressing without any glue. In this way, several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single lacquer sound disc. When only a few hundred discs are required, instead of electroforming a \"son\" (for each side), the \"father\" is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper. Production by this latter method, known as the \"two-step-process\" (as it does not entail creation of \"sons\" but does involve creation of \"mothers,\" which are used for test playing and kept as \"safeties\" for electroforming future \"sons\") is limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings. The pressing count can increase if the stamper holds out and the quality of the vinyl is high. The \"sons\" made during a \"three-step\" electroforming make better stampers since they don't require silver removal (which reduces some high fidelity because of etching erasing part of the smallest groove modulations) and also because they have a stronger metal structure than \"fathers\".", "users": [{"userType": "Human", "id": "Bob"}, {"userType": "Human", "id": "Alice"}], "evaluation": [{"breadth": 4, "userId": "Alice", "quality": 3, "engagement": 4}, {"breadth": 1, "userId": "Bob", "quality": 1, "engagement": 1}], "thread": [{"evaluation": 0, "text": "Hi!

After the festival, the three visited D\u00fcsseldorf, where Mendelssohn had been appointed musical director. They spent what Mendelssohn described as \"a very agreeable day\", playing and discussing music at his piano, and met Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as Lessing, Bendemann, Hildebrandt and Sohn. In 1835 Chopin went to Carlsbad, where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzi\u0144skis. He had made the acquaintance of their daughter Maria in Poland five years earlier, when she was eleven. This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via Leipzig. The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is considered, along with Delacroix's, as among Chopin's best likenesses. In October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, Clara Wieck and Felix Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio St. Paul, and who considered him \"a perfect musician\". In July 1836 Chopin travelled to Marienbad and Dresden to be with the Wodzi\u0144ski family, and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzi\u0144ska approved in principle.

Some organisms can grow extremely rapidly when nutrients become available, such as the formation of algal (and cyanobacterial) blooms that often occur in lakes during the summer. Other organisms have adaptations to harsh environments, such as the production of multiple antibiotics by Streptomyces that inhibit the growth of competing microorganisms.

These relationships can be essential for growth of a particular organism or group of organisms (syntrophy).", "users": [{"userType": "Human", "id": "Alice"}, {"userType": "Human", "id": "Bob"}], "evaluation": [{"breadth": 1, "userId": "Alice", "quality": 1, "engagement": 1}, {"breadth": 3, "userId": "Bob", "quality": 2, "engagement": 4}], "thread": [{"evaluation": 0, "text": "hi", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 1, "NP_LEN": 0, "NLL": NaN}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "hello", "userId": "Alice", "UTT_LEN": 1, "NP_LEN": 0, "NLL": NaN}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "and what is your favourite food?))", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 7, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 90.49894489200904}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "and do you make any relationships to get food?", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 10, "NP_LEN": 3, "NLL": 177.76608542869147}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "what?", "userId": "Alice", "UTT_LEN": 2, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 82.50988388409375}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "what relationships?", "userId": "Alice", "UTT_LEN": 3, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 10144.486845252}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "hah)", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 2, "NP_LEN": 0, "NLL": 163.4272334629821}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "damn bot)", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 3, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 342.5990202598735}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "can you give me some example of relationships to get food?", "userId": "Alice", "UTT_LEN": 12, "NP_LEN": 7, "NLL": 89.52934427897023}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "it's a joke)", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 6, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 36.376088440127674}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "any communities", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 2, "NP_LEN": 1, "NLL": 81369.44117125157}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "as organisms do", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 3, "NP_LEN": 1, "NLL": 64844.303128757594}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "did you read the text?", "userId": "Alice", "UTT_LEN": 6, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 28.854186539172854}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "text is about food for microorganisms", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 6, "NP_LEN": 4, "NLL": 350.09727361954157}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "nutrient", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 1, "NP_LEN": 0, "NLL": 3980.3098702216294}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "i don't think that it is about food", "userId": "Alice", "UTT_LEN": 10, "NP_LEN": 3, "NLL": 52.242701258800466}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "and what does nutrient means, as you suppose?", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 10, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 513.6633493561421}], "dialogId": 502894566}, {"context": "That same year, the comedy Junior was released, the last of Schwarzenegger's three collaborations with Ivan Reitman and again co-starring Danny DeVito.

There is evidence that gold and meteoric iron (but not iron smelting) were the only metals used by humans before copper. The history of copper metallurgy is thought to have followed the following sequence: 1) cold working of native copper, 2) annealing, 3) smelting, and 4) the lost wax method. In southeastern Anatolia, all four of these metallurgical techniques appears more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the Neolithic c. 7500 BC. However, just as agriculture was independently invented in several parts of the world, copper smelting was invented locally in several different places. It was probably discovered independently in China before 2800 BC, in Central America perhaps around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting was invented in 4500\u20134000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK at 2280 to 1890 BC. \u00d6tzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300\u20133200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest his involvement in copper smelting. Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led to the discovery of iron smelting. Production in the Old Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.[citation needed]", "users": [{"userType": "Human", "id": "Alice"}, {"userType": "Human", "id": "Bob"}], "evaluation": [{"breadth": 1, "userId": "Alice", "quality": 1, "engagement": 1}, {"breadth": 5, "userId": "Bob", "quality": 5, "engagement": 5}], "thread": [{"evaluation": 2, "text": "\u043a\u0430\u043a \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 5, "NP_LEN": 3, "NLL": 7.8765123596614295}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "\u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0430\u044e \u0432 \u0430\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0443", "userId": "Alice", "UTT_LEN": 3, "NP_LEN": 1, "NLL": 9.663658442533544}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0436\u0435..", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 3, "NP_LEN": 0, "NLL": 79.70677188753757}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "\u041d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e?", "userId": "Alice", "UTT_LEN": 3, "NP_LEN": 1, "NLL": 17.795758325822845}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "\u0448\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043a\u0430", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 1, "NP_LEN": 1, "NLL": 7.31319528847209}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "\u0418 \u0433\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u044f?", "userId": "Alice", "UTT_LEN": 3, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 18.02071072454191}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "\u043d\u0435, \u0433\u0435\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043a\u0430", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 3, "NP_LEN": 1, "NLL": 15.462107494665059}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "\u0430 \u0442\u044b", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 2, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 80.23200534659179}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "\u0411\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0438.", "userId": "Alice", "UTT_LEN": 3, "NP_LEN": 1, "NLL": 7.338441655521993}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0434\u0430", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 2, "NP_LEN": 1, "NLL": 10.202358931379198}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "\u0424\u041e\u041f\u0424 \u041c\u0424\u0422\u0418.", "userId": "Alice", "UTT_LEN": 3, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 11.085690645578845}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "\u043d\u043e\u0440\u043c", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 1, "NP_LEN": 1, "NLL": 26.23793935818374}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "\u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438)", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 3, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 25.969783500511287}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "\u0449\u0430 \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0444\u043e\u043f\u0444, \u043a\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 6, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 11.016078510654616}], "dialogId": -1792662213}, {"context": "Mining was important in Thuringia since the later Middle Ages, especially within the mining towns of the Thuringian Forest such as Schmalkalden, Suhl and Ilmenau.

The Frankish lands were rural in character, with only a few small cities. Most of the people were peasants settled on small farms. Little trade existed and much of that was with the British Isles and Scandinavia, in contrast to the older Roman Empire with its trading networks centred on the Mediterranean. The empire was administered by an itinerant court that travelled with the emperor, as well as approximately 300 imperial officials called counts, who administered the counties the empire had been divided into. Clergy and local bishops served as officials, as well as the imperial officials called missi dominici, who served as roving inspectors and troubleshooters.", "users": [{"userType": "Human", "id": "Alice"}, {"userType": "Human", "id": "Bob"}], "evaluation": [{"breadth": 1, "userId": "Alice", "quality": 3, "engagement": 5}, {"breadth": 3, "userId": "Bob", "quality": 4, "engagement": 3}], "thread": [{"evaluation": 1, "text": "War is bad.", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 4, "NP_LEN": 1, "NLL": 113.88497650748877}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "but this is inevitable :)", "userId": "Alice", "UTT_LEN": 5, "NP_LEN": 1, "NLL": 359.41376641463523}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "ok, what do you know about Byzantine Empire?", "userId": "Alice", "UTT_LEN": 10, "NP_LEN": 3, "NLL": 38.45255061932001}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "Almost nothin i afraid.", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 5, "NP_LEN": 1, "NLL": 1991.3082758707305}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "And i dont think, if something ineveitavle, then we should aloow it.", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 15, "NP_LEN": 4, "NLL": 337.8850489237332}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "I mean not in any cases.", "userId": "Bob", "UTT_LEN": 7, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 131.58116557570327}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "I'm talking about history.

The entrepreneur Aristide Boucicaut became a partner in 1852, and changed the marketing plan, instituting fixed prices and guarantees that allowed exchanges and refunds, advertising, and a much wider variety of merchandise. The annual income of the store increased from 500,000 francs in 1852 to five million in 1860. In 1869 he built much larger building at 24 rue de S\u00e8vres on the Left Bank, and enlarged the store again in 1872, with help from the engineering firm of Gustave Eiffel, creator of the Eiffel Tower. The income rose from twenty million francs in 1870 to 72 million at the time of the Boucicaut's death in 1877.

Another archaic term for asphalt/bitumen is \"pitch\".", "users": [{"userType": "Human", "id": "Alice"}, {"userType": "Human", "id": "Bob"}], "evaluation": [{"breadth": 3, "userId": "Alice", "quality": 3, "engagement": 2}, {"breadth": 5, "userId": "Bob", "quality": 5, "engagement": 5}], "thread": [{"evaluation": 0, "text": "hi", "userId": "Alice", "time": 27000000, "UTT_LEN": 1, "NP_LEN": 0, "NLL": NaN}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "Let's talk about the distillation process of alcohol", "userId": "Bob", "time": 27000000, "UTT_LEN": 10, "NP_LEN": 4, "NLL": 19.294135643155236}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "do you know that bitumen is also used to cover roofs?", "userId": "Alice", "time": 27000000, "UTT_LEN": 12, "NP_LEN": 3, "NLL": 66.04288338753602}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "alcohol?", "userId": "Alice", "time": 27000000, "UTT_LEN": 2, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 4316.775771299705}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "Ethyl alcohol is the main component of most drinks", "userId": "Bob", "time": 27000000, "UTT_LEN": 9, "NP_LEN": 4, "NLL": 23.31092107800054}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "Which drinks do you prefer?", "userId": "Alice", "time": 27000000, "UTT_LEN": 6, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 72.63023659410618}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "Appletini", "userId": "Bob", "time": 27000000, "UTT_LEN": 1, "NP_LEN": 1, "NLL": 556.2845826443839}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "And you?", "userId": "Bob", "time": 27000000, "UTT_LEN": 3, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 83.89279053172416}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "Water", "userId": "Alice", "time": 27000000, "UTT_LEN": 1, "NP_LEN": 1, "NLL": NaN}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "What is Appletini?", "userId": "Alice", "time": 27000000, "UTT_LEN": 4, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 71.34104231233573}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "It's apple martini", "userId": "Bob", "time": 27000000, "UTT_LEN": 5, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 570.8834851965623}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "Leave this all behind, le's run away together", "userId": "Bob", "time": 27000000, "UTT_LEN": 11, "NP_LEN": 3, "NLL": 702.7728214671731}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "What is it made of?", "userId": "Alice", "time": 27000000, "UTT_LEN": 6, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 10.584359410939568}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "to the stars and far away", "userId": "Alice", "time": 27000000, "UTT_LEN": 6, "NP_LEN": 1, "NLL": 112.94894059957652}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "It's made of apples and martini", "userId": "Bob", "time": 27000000, "UTT_LEN": 8, "NP_LEN": 3, "NLL": 230.92354844374614}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "Martini contains alcohol, did you know?", "userId": "Alice", "time": 27000000, "UTT_LEN": 8, "NP_LEN": 3, "NLL": 69.8979261666051}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "That explains why I am giggling uncontrolably after it", "userId": "Bob", "time": 27000000, "UTT_LEN": 9, "NP_LEN": 3, "NLL": 253.81238301706915}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "are you a boy or a girl?", "userId": "Alice", "time": 27000000, "UTT_LEN": 8, "NP_LEN": 4, "NLL": 11.611650675290681}], "dialogId": -1834850699}, {"context": "At June 1985's Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Nintendo unveiled the American version of its Famicom.

Note that antenna efficiency is a separate issue from impedance matching, which may also reduce the amount of power radiated using a given transmitter. If an SWR meter reads 150 W of incident power and 50 W of reflected power, that means that 100 W have actually been absorbed by the antenna (ignoring transmission line losses).

Strongly influenced by the city's immigrants, productions such as those of Harrigan and Hart, George M. Cohan, and others used song in narratives that often reflected themes of hope and ambition.", "users": [{"userType": "Human", "id": "Bob"}, {"userType": "Human", "id": "Alice"}], "evaluation": [{"breadth": 5, "userId": "Bob", "quality": 5, "engagement": 5}, {"breadth": 4, "userId": "Alice", "quality": 5, "engagement": 4}], "thread": [{"evaluation": 0, "text": "hi", "userId": "Alice", "time": 500000000, "UTT_LEN": 1, "NP_LEN": 0, "NLL": NaN}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "Hi!", "userId": "Bob", "time": 500000000, "UTT_LEN": 2, "NP_LEN": 0, "NLL": 124.81144532581853}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "Have you ever been in New York?", "userId": "Bob", "time": 500000000, "UTT_LEN": 8, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 11.090092171780336}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "oh no. it's a ver big city", "userId": "Alice", "time": 500000000, "UTT_LEN": 10, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 470.28926792544564}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "And you do not like big cities?", "userId": "Bob", "time": 500000000, "UTT_LEN": 8, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 51.16298869850033}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "you are right", "userId": "Alice", "time": 500000000, "UTT_LEN": 3, "NP_LEN": 1, "NLL": 61.474402736102604}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "Are you in Dolgoprudniy?", "userId": "Bob", "time": 500000000, "UTT_LEN": 5, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 126.77234532971454}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "how about you?", "userId": "Alice", "time": 500000000, "UTT_LEN": 4, "NP_LEN": 1, "NLL": 36.76478973507255}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "what does Dolgoprudniy mean?", "userId": "Alice", "time": 500000000, "UTT_LEN": 5, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 85.03713595403448}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "Before MIPT I lived in Saratov, there are about 1 mln people.

This is called a substitutional alloy. Examples of substitutional alloys include bronze and brass, in which some of the copper atoms are substituted with either tin or zinc atoms. With the interstitial mechanism, one atom is usually much smaller than the other, so cannot successfully replace an atom in the crystals of the base metal. The smaller atoms become trapped in the spaces between the atoms in the crystal matrix, called the interstices. This is referred to as an interstitial alloy. Steel is an example of an interstitial alloy, because the very small carbon atoms fit into interstices of the iron matrix.

Other essential nutrients that are not classified as vitamins include essential amino acids (see above), choline, essential fatty acids (see above), and the minerals discussed in the preceding section.", "users": [{"userType": "Human", "id": "Alice"}, {"userType": "Human", "id": "Bob"}], "evaluation": [{"breadth": 5, "userId": "Alice", "quality": 5, "engagement": 5}, {"breadth": 4, "userId": "Bob", "quality": 5, "engagement": 5}], "thread": [{"evaluation": 0, "text": "Hi!", "userId": "Alice", "time": 475000000, "UTT_LEN": 2, "NP_LEN": 0, "NLL": 124.81144532581853}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "What are nutrients?", "userId": "Bob", "time": 475000000, "UTT_LEN": 4, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 149.58452448405797}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "HELLO!", "userId": "Bob", "time": 475000000, "UTT_LEN": 2, "NP_LEN": 0, "NLL": 13.57777088660938}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "Did you read the article?", "userId": "Bob", "time": 475000000, "UTT_LEN": 6, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 8.431389480311093}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "Something important for our organism", "userId": "Alice", "time": 475000000, "UTT_LEN": 5, "NP_LEN": 3, "NLL": 559.5026710284898}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "I'm trying", "userId": "Alice", "time": 475000000, "UTT_LEN": 4, "NP_LEN": 1, "NLL": 21.191917555503217}, {"evaluation": 1, "text": "What did you read last time?", "userId": "Bob", "time": 475000000, "UTT_LEN": 7, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 28.945944754817923}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "Are you asking about literature?", "userId": "Alice", "time": 475000000, "UTT_LEN": 6, "NP_LEN": 2, "NLL": 71.6734564237933}, {"evaluation": 1, "text": "Yes, can you call me \u00ablord\u00bb?", "userId": "Bob", "time": 475000000, "UTT_LEN": 9, "NP_LEN": 4, "NLL": 62.32510244129762}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "sure, my lord", "userId": "Alice", "time": 475000000, "UTT_LEN": 4, "NP_LEN": 0, "NLL": 95.35290159488004}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "So, what about reading and literature?", "userId": "Bob", "time": 475000000, "UTT_LEN": 8, "NP_LEN": 5, "NLL": 47.82331010730893}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "my lord, the last book that I read was Aviator by Vodolazkin", "userId": "Alice", "time": 475000000, "UTT_LEN": 13, "NP_LEN": 9, "NLL": 157.89784912396016}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "What about you, my lord?", "userId": "Alice", "time": 475000000, "UTT_LEN": 7, "NP_LEN": 3, "NLL": 62.603266377038956}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "I read \u00abhow to tackle FOREX\u00bb by FOREX CLUB", "userId": "Bob", "time": 475000000, "UTT_LEN": 11, "NP_LEN": 3, "NLL": 323.70059909028254}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "Ha!

St. John's experiences milder temperatures during the winter season in comparison to other Canadian cities, and has the mildest winter for any Canadian city outside of British Columbia. Precipitation is frequent and often heavy, falling year round. On average, summer is the driest season, with only occasional thunderstorm activity, and the wettest months are from October to January, with December the wettest single month, with nearly 165 millimetres of precipitation on average. This winter precipitation maximum is quite unusual for humid continental climates, which most commonly have a late spring or early summer precipitation maximum (for example, most of the Midwestern U.S.). Most heavy precipitation events in St. John's are the product of intense mid-latitude storms migrating from the Northeastern U.S. and New England states, and these are most common and intense from October to March, bringing heavy precipitation (commonly 4 to 8 centimetres of rainfall equivalent in a single storm), and strong winds. In winter, two or more types of precipitation (rain, freezing rain, sleet and snow) can fall from passage of a single storm. Snowfall is heavy, averaging nearly 335 centimetres per winter season. However, winter storms can bring changing precipitation types. Heavy snow can transition to heavy rain, melting the snow cover, and possibly back to snow or ice (perhaps briefly) all in the same storm, resulting in little or no net snow accumulation. Snow cover in St. John's is variable, and especially early in the winter season, may be slow to develop, but can extend deeply into the spring months (March, April). The St. John's area is subject to freezing rain (called \"silver thaws\"), the worst of which paralyzed the city over a three-day period in April 1984.", "users": [{"userType": "Human", "id": "Bob"},

Bradbury takes a moderate line, but suggests that in recent years modern historians have been overly lenient towards John's numerous faults.

It is the capital city of Jiangsu province of People's Republic of China and the second largest city in East China, with a total population of 8,216,100, and legally the capital of Republic of China which lost the mainland during the civil war. The city whose name means \"Southern Capital\" has a prominent place in Chinese history and culture, having served as the capitals of various Chinese dynasties, kingdoms and republican governments dating from the 3rd century AD to 1949. Prior to the advent of pinyin romanization, Nanjing's city name was spelled as Nanking or Nankin. Nanjing has a number of other names, and some historical names are now used as names of districts of the city, and among them there is the name Jiangning (\u6c5f\u5be7), whose former character Jiang (\u6c5f, River) is the former part of the name Jiangsu and latter character Ning (\u5be7, simplified form \u5b81, Peace) is the short name of Nanjing. When being the capital of a state, for instance, ROC, Jing (\u4eac) is adopted as the abbreviation of Nanjing. Although as a city located in southern part of China becoming Chinese national capital as early as in Jin dynasty, the name Nanjing was designated to the city in Ming dynasty, about a thousand years later.

An endurantist holds that for an object to persist through time is for it to exist completely at different times (each instance of existence we can regard as somehow separate from previous and future instances, though still numerically identical with them).

The Seleucid Antiochus III had allied with Philip V of Macedon in 203 BC, agreeing that they should jointly conquer the lands of the boy-king of Egypt, Ptolemy V. After defeating Ptolemy in the Fifth Syrian War, Antiochus concentrated on occupying the Ptolemaic possessions in Asia Minor. However, this brought Antiochus into conflict with Rhodes and Pergamum, two important Roman allies, and began a 'cold war' between Rome and Antiochus (not helped by the presence of Hannibal at the Seleucid court). Meanwhile, in mainland Greece, the Aetolian League, which had sided with Rome against Macedon, now grew to resent the Roman presence in Greece. This presented Antiochus III with a pretext to invade Greece and 'liberate' it from Roman influence, thus starting the Roman-Syrian War (192\u2013188 BC).

The Parian Chronicle says that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Greeks (\u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of Hellenes, was son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, who ruled around Phthia, the only survivors after the great deluge. It seems that the myth was invented when the Greek tribes started to separate from each other in certain areas of Greece and it indicates their common origin. Aristotle names ancient Hellas as an area in Epirus between Dodona and the Achelous river, the location of the great deluge of Deucalion, a land occupied by the Selloi and the \"Greeks\" who later came to be known as \"Hellenes\". Selloi were the priests of Dodonian Zeus and the word probably means \"sacrificers\" (compare Gothic saljan, \"present, sacrifice\"). There is currently no satisfactory etymology of the name Hellenes. Some scholars assert that the name Selloi changed to Sellanes and then to Hellanes-Hellenes. However this etymology connects the name Hellenes with the Dorians who occupied Epirus and the relation with the name Greeks given by the Romans becomes uncertain. The name Hellenes seems to be older and it was probably used by the Greeks with the establishment of the Great Amphictyonic League. This was an ancient association of Greek tribes with twelve founders which was organized to protect the great temples of Apollo in Delphi (Phocis) and of Demeter near Thermopylae (Locris).

This conceptual distinction continues to operate in political science, although some political scientists, philosophers, historians and cultural anthropologists have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state, and that there are societies that are not organized into states that nevertheless must be considered in political terms.

Many local Carnival customs are claimed to derive from local pre-Christian rituals, such as elaborate rites involving masked figures in the Swabian\u2013Alemannic Fastnacht. However, evidence is insufficient to establish a direct origin from Saturnalia or other ancient festivals. No complete accounts of Saturnalia survive and the shared features of feasting, role reversals, temporary social equality, masks and permitted rule-breaking do not necessarily constitute a coherent festival or link these festivals. These similarities may represent a reservoir of cultural resources that can embody multiple meanings and functions. For example, Easter begins with the resurrection of Jesus, followed by a liminal period and ends with rebirth. Carnival reverses this as King Carnival comes to life, a liminal period follows before his death. Both feasts are calculated by the lunar calendar. Both Jesus and King Carnival may be seen as expiatory figures who make a gift to the people with their deaths. In the case of Jesus, the gift is eternal life in heaven and in the case of King Carnival, the acknowledgement that death is a necessary part of the cycle of life. Besides Christian anti-Judaism, the commonalities between church and Carnival rituals and imagery suggest a common root. Christ's passion is itself grotesque: Since early Christianity Christ is figured as the victim of summary judgement, is tortured and executed by Romans before a Jewish mob (\"His blood is on us and on our children!\" Matthew 27:24\u201325). Holy Week processions in Spain include crowds who vociferously insult the figure of Jesus. Irreverence, parody, degradation and laughter at a tragicomic effigy God can be seen as intensifications of the sacred order. In 1466, the Catholic Church under Pope Paul II revieved customs of the Saturnalia carnival: Jews were forced to race naked through the streets of the city of Rome. \u201cBefore they were to run, the Jews were richly fed, so as to make the race more difficult for them and at the same time more amusing for spectators.

The fall of Vienna provided the French a huge bounty as they captured 100,000 muskets, 500 cannons, and the intact bridges across the Danube. At this critical juncture, both Tsar Alexander I and Holy Roman Emperor Francis II decided to engage Napoleon in battle, despite reservations from some of their subordinates. Napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of the Allies, but then ordered his forces to retreat so that he could feign a grave weakness. Desperate to lure the Allies into battle, Napoleon gave every indication in the days preceding the engagement that the French army was in a pitiful state, even abandoning the dominant Pratzen Heights near the village of Austerlitz. At the Battle of Austerlitz, in Moravia on 2 December, he deployed the French army below the Pratzen Heights and deliberately weakened his right flank, enticing the Allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole French line. A forced march from Vienna by Marshal Davout and his III Corps plugged the gap left by Napoleon just in time. Meanwhile, the heavy Allied deployment against the French right weakened their center on the Pratzen Heights, which was viciously attacked by the IV Corps of Marshal Soult. With the Allied center demolished, the French swept through both enemy flanks and sent the Allies fleeing chaotically, capturing thousands of prisoners in the process. The battle is often seen as a tactical masterpiece because of the near-perfect execution of a calibrated but dangerous plan \u2014 of the same stature as Cannae, the celebrated triumph by Hannibal some 2000 years before.", "users": [{"userType": "Human", "id": "Bob"}, {"userType": "Human", "id": "Alice"}], "evaluation": [{"breadth": 5, "userId": "Alice", "quality": 5, "engagement": 5}, {"breadth": 5, "userId": "Bob", "quality": 5, "engagement": 5}], "thread": [{"evaluation": 2, "text": "Can you tell which war are we talking about?", "userId": "Alice", "time": 946000000, "UTT_LEN": 10, "NP_LEN": 3, "NLL": 24.955861550808034}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "Hard to say, definitely one of the Napoleonic wars.", "userId": "Bob", "time": 946000000, "UTT_LEN": 11, "NP_LEN": 1, "NLL": 24.119130757100937}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "Yes, do like history?", "userId": "Alice", "time": 946000000, "UTT_LEN": 6, "NP_LEN": 1, "NLL": 275.14339666332364}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "Yep, but I'd like to have more time to study it.
