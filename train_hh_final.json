Danko of the United States Army Signal Corps developed the Auto-Sembly process in which component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and dip soldered. The patent they obtained in 1956 was assigned to the U.S. Army. With the development of board lamination and etching techniques, this concept evolved into the standard printed circuit board fabrication process in use today.

human affairs.

Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances. Women, slaves, and children all participated in a range of religious activities.

Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge\u2019s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo\u2019s choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing.", "users": [{"userType": "Human", "id": "Alice"}, {"userType": "Human", "id": "Bob"}], "evaluation": [{"breadth": 3, "userId": "Alice", "quality": 3, "engagement": 3}, {"breadth": 3, "userId": "Bob", "quality": 3, "engagement": 3}], "thread": [{"evaluation": 2, "text": "Now, nintendo is a remnant of the past.", "userId": "Bob", "NP": ["nintendo", "a remnant", "a remnant of the past", "the past"], "UTT_LEN": 10, "UTT": ["Now", ",", "nintendo", "is", "a", "remnant", "of", "the", "past", "."], "NLL": 57.60118214375429}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "Thou it was quite a tech company in its days", "userId": "Alice", "NP": ["it", "its days", "quite a tech company"], "UTT_LEN": 10, "UTT": ["Thou", "it", "was", "quite", "a", "tech", "company", "in", "its", "days"], "NLL": 313.65895793155454}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "My statetment is only about game consoles.", "userId": "Bob", "NP": ["game consoles", "My statetment"], "UTT_LEN": 8, "UTT": ["My", "statetment", "is", "only", "about", "game", "consoles", "."], "NLL": 779.8614441176671}], "dialogId": -1868945774}, {"context": "In 2002, Elizabeth marked her Golden Jubilee.

For example, steel is stronger than iron, its primary element. The electrical and thermal conductivity of alloys is usually lower than that of the pure metals. The physical properties, such as density, reactivity, Young's modulus of an alloy may not differ greatly from those of its elements, but engineering properties such as tensile strength and shear strength may be substantially different from those of the constituent materials. This is sometimes a result of the sizes of the atoms in the alloy, because larger atoms exert a compressive force on neighboring atoms, and smaller atoms exert a tensile force on their neighbors, helping the alloy resist deformation. Sometimes alloys may exhibit marked differences in behavior even when small amounts of one element are present. For example, impurities in semiconducting ferromagnetic alloys lead to different properties, as first predicted by White, Hogan, Suhl, Tian Abrie and Nakamura. Some alloys are made by melting and mixing two or more metals. Bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, was the first alloy discovered, during the prehistoric period now known as the bronze age; it was harder than pure copper and originally used to make tools and weapons, but was later superseded by metals and alloys with better properties. In later times bronze has been used for ornaments, bells, statues, and bearings.

Boyle was \"a founder of the experimental world in which scientists now live and operate,\" and his method based knowledge on experimentation, which had to be witnessed to provide proper empirical legitimacy.

EMF2 (previously a Wang facility, later occupied by Flextronics, situated in Castletroy) closed in 2002,[citation needed] and Dell Inc. has consolidated production into EMF3 (EMF1 now[when?] contains only offices). Subsidies from the Polish government did keep Dell for a long time.

The blank records for cutting used to be cooked up, as needed, by the cutting engineer, using what Robert K. Morrison describes as a \"metallic soap,\" containing lead litharge, ozokerite, barium sulfate, montan wax, stearin and paraffin, among other ingredients. Cut \"wax\" sound discs would be placed in a vacuum chamber and gold-sputtered to make them electrically conductive for use as mandrels in an electroforming bath, where pressing stamper parts were made. Later, the French company Pyral invented a ready-made blank disc having a thin nitro-cellulose lacquer coating (approximately 7 mils thickness on both sides) that was applied to an aluminum substrate. Lacquer cuts result in an immediately playable, or processable, master record. If vinyl pressings are wanted, the still-unplayed sound disc is used as a mandrel for electroforming nickel records that are used for manufacturing pressing stampers. The electroformed nickel records are mechanically separated from their respective mandrels. This is done with relative ease because no actual \"plating\" of the mandrel occurs in the type of electrodeposition known as electroforming, unlike with electroplating, in which the adhesion of the new phase of metal is chemical and relatively permanent. The one-molecule-thick coating of silver (that was sprayed onto the processed lacquer sound disc in order to make its surface electrically conductive) reverse-plates onto the nickel record's face. This negative impression disc (having ridges in place of grooves) is known as a nickel master, \"matrix\" or \"father.\" The \"father\" is then used as a mandrel to electroform a positive disc known as a \"mother\". Many mothers can be grown on a single \"father\" before ridges deteriorate beyond effective use. The \"mothers\" are then used as mandrels for electroforming more negative discs known as \"sons\". Each \"mother\" can be used to make many \"sons\" before deteriorating. The \"sons\" are then converted into \"stampers\" by center-punching a spindle hole (which was lost from the lacquer sound disc during initial electroforming of the \"father\"), and by custom-forming the target pressing profile. This allows them to be placed in the dies of the target (make and model) record press and, by center-roughing, to facilitate the adhesion of the label, which gets stuck onto the vinyl pressing without any glue. In this way, several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single lacquer sound disc. When only a few hundred discs are required, instead of electroforming a \"son\" (for each side), the \"father\" is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper. Production by this latter method, known as the \"two-step-process\" (as it does not entail creation of \"sons\" but does involve creation of \"mothers,\" which are used for test playing and kept as \"safeties\" for electroforming future \"sons\") is limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings. The pressing count can increase if the stamper holds out and the quality of the vinyl is high. The \"sons\" made during a \"three-step\" electroforming make better stampers since they don't require silver removal (which reduces some high fidelity because of etching erasing part of the smallest groove modulations) and also because they have a stronger metal structure than \"fathers\".", "users": [{"userType": "Human", "id": "Bob"}, {"userType": "Human", "id": "Alice"}], "evaluation": [{"breadth": 4, "userId": "Alice", "quality": 3, "engagement": 4}, {"breadth": 1, "userId": "Bob", "quality": 1, "engagement": 1}], "thread": [{"evaluation": 0, "text": "Hi!

After the festival, the three visited D\u00fcsseldorf, where Mendelssohn had been appointed musical director. They spent what Mendelssohn described as \"a very agreeable day\", playing and discussing music at his piano, and met Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as Lessing, Bendemann, Hildebrandt and Sohn. In 1835 Chopin went to Carlsbad, where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzi\u0144skis. He had made the acquaintance of their daughter Maria in Poland five years earlier, when she was eleven. This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via Leipzig. The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is considered, along with Delacroix's, as among Chopin's best likenesses. In October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, Clara Wieck and Felix Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio St. Paul, and who considered him \"a perfect musician\". In July 1836 Chopin travelled to Marienbad and Dresden to be with the Wodzi\u0144ski family, and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzi\u0144ska approved in principle. Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his G minor Ballade. At the end of 1836 he sent Maria an album in which his sister Ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs, and his 1835 Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1.

This nutrient limitation has led the evolution of different growth strategies (see r/K selection theory). Some organisms can grow extremely rapidly when nutrients become available, such as the formation of algal (and cyanobacterial) blooms that often occur in lakes during the summer. Other organisms have adaptations to harsh environments, such as the production of multiple antibiotics by Streptomyces that inhibit the growth of competing microorganisms. In nature, many organisms live in communities (e.g., biofilms) that may allow for increased supply of nutrients and protection from environmental stresses.

Although the British Empire achieved its largest territorial extent immediately after World War I, Britain was no longer the world's pre-eminent industrial or military power. In the Second World War, Britain's colonies in South-East Asia were occupied by Imperial Japan. Despite the final victory of Britain and its allies, the damage to British prestige helped to accelerate the decline of the empire. India, Britain's most valuable and populous possession, achieved independence as part of a larger decolonisation movement in which Britain granted independence to most territories of the Empire. The transfer of Hong Kong to China in 1997 marked for many the end of the British Empire. Fourteen overseas territories remain under British sovereignty. After independence, many former British colonies joined the Commonwealth of Nations, a free association of independent states. The United Kingdom is now one of 16 Commonwealth nations, a grouping known informally as the Commonwealth realms, that share one monarch\u2014Queen Elizabeth II.", "users": [{"userType": "Human", "id": "Alice"}, {"userType": "Human", "id": "Bob"}], "evaluation": [{"breadth": 4, "userId": "Bob", "quality": 5, "engagement": 4}, {"breadth": 3, "userId": "Alice", "quality": 3, "engagement": 5}], "thread": [{"evaluation": 0, "text": "hi", "userId": "Alice", "NP": [], "UTT_LEN": 1, "UTT": ["hi"], "NLL": NaN}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "hi", "userId": "Bob", "NP": [], "UTT_LEN": 1, "UTT": ["hi"], "NLL": NaN}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "i found the snippet a bit confusing to read", "userId": "Alice", "NP": ["the snippet", "i"], "UTT_LEN": 9, "UTT": ["i", "found", "the", "snippet", "a", "bit", "confusing", "to", "read"], "NLL": 88.30778642602}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "because of the way it jumps from world war 1 to world war 2", "userId": "Alice", "NP": ["the way", "it", "world war", "world war 1", "the way it jumps from world war 1 to world war"], "UTT_LEN": 14, "UTT": ["because", "of", "the", "way", "it", "jumps", "from", "world", "war", "1", "to", "world", "war", "2"], "NLL": 29.672130679824235}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "all the snippets i've read before are a bit confusing to read", "userId": "Bob", "NP": ["all the snippets i've read before", "all the snippets", "i"], "UTT_LEN": 14, "UTT": ["all", "the", "snippets", "i", "'", "ve", "read", "before", "are", "a", "bit", "confusing", "to", "read"], "NLL": 98.27699903718653}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "How come?", "userId": "Alice", "NP": [], "UTT_LEN": 3, "UTT": ["How", "come", "?"], "NLL": 234.2725711534017}, {"evaluation": 1, "text": "what come?", "userId": "Bob", "NP": ["what"], "UTT_LEN": 3, "UTT": ["what", "come", "?"], "NLL": 414.96886254188036}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "Why did you find them confusing?", "userId": "Alice", "NP": ["you", "them"], "UTT_LEN": 7, "UTT": ["Why", "did", "you", "find", "them", "confusing", "?"], "NLL": 65.74263328208102}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "they are boring", "userId": "Bob", "NP": ["they"], "UTT_LEN": 3, "UTT": ["they", "are", "boring"], "NLL": 776.8584655149136}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "and hard to read for me", "userId": "Bob", "NP": ["me"], "UTT_LEN": 6, "UTT": ["and", "hard", "to", "read", "for", "me"], "NLL": 103.96749006035755}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "yea, i guess they just take some random paragraphs from wikipedia?", "userId": "Alice", "NP": ["they", "some random paragraphs from wikipedia", "wikipedia", "i", "some random paragraphs"], "UTT_LEN": 13, "UTT": ["yea", ",", "i", "guess", "they", "just", "take", "some", "random", "paragraphs", "from", "wikipedia", "?"], "NLL": 113.85223554786275}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "yeap", "userId": "Bob", "NP": ["yeap"], "UTT_LEN": 1, "UTT": ["yeap"], "NLL": 4702.769492975958}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "and topics is not very interesting for me", "userId": "Bob", "NP": ["me", "topics"], "UTT_LEN": 8, "UTT": ["and", "topics", "is", "not", "very", "interesting", "for", "me"], "NLL": 136.6853019127191}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "\ud83d\udc4d", "userId": "Alice", "NP": [], "UTT_LEN": 1, "UTT": ["\ud83d\udc4d"], "NLL": 1601.308327355066}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": ":)", "userId": "Bob", "NP": [], "UTT_LEN": 1, "UTT": [":)"], "NLL": 593.4805536306988}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "ok got to go, bye!", "userId": "Alice", "NP": [], "UTT_LEN": 7, "UTT": ["ok", "got", "to", "go", ",", "bye", "!"], "NLL": 157.78134079175496}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "bye", "userId": "Bob", "NP": [], "UTT_LEN": 1, "UTT": ["bye"], "NLL": NaN}], "dialogId": -1562961640}, {"context": "Raleigh is located in the northeast central region of North Carolina, where the Piedmont and Atlantic Coastal Plain regions meet.

There is evidence that gold and meteoric iron (but not iron smelting) were the only metals used by humans before copper. The history of copper metallurgy is thought to have followed the following sequence: 1) cold working of native copper, 2) annealing, 3) smelting, and 4) the lost wax method. In southeastern Anatolia, all four of these metallurgical techniques appears more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the Neolithic c. 7500 BC. However, just as agriculture was independently invented in several parts of the world, copper smelting was invented locally in several different places. It was probably discovered independently in China before 2800 BC, in Central America perhaps around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting was invented in 4500\u20134000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK at 2280 to 1890 BC. \u00d6tzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300\u20133200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest his involvement in copper smelting. Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led to the discovery of iron smelting. Production in the Old Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.[citation needed]", "users": [{"userType": "Human",

Following the industrial revolution, the old iron, copper and silver mines declined because the competition from imported metal was too strong. On the other hand, the late 19th century brought new types of mines to Thuringia: the lignite surface mining around Meuselwitz near Altenburg in the east of the Land started in the 1870s, and two potash mining districts were established around 1900. These are the S\u00fcdharzrevier in the north of the state, between Bischofferode in the west and Ro\u00dfleben in the east with Sondershausen at its centre, and the Werrarevier on the Hessian border around Vacha and Bad Salzungen in the west. Together, they accounted for a significant part of the world's potash production in the mid-20th century. After the reunification, the S\u00fcdharzrevier was abandoned, whereas K+S took over the mines in the Werrarevier. Between 1950 and 1990, uranium mining was also important to cover the Soviet Union's need for this metal.

In 1885 Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul \u00c9mile Roux created the first rabies vaccine. The first diphtheria vaccines were produced in 1914 from a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin (produced from the serum of an inoculated animal), but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used. The United States recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria in 1921 resulting in 15,520 deaths. In 1923 parallel efforts by Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute and Alexander Glenny at the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later part of GlaxoSmithKline) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with formaldehyde. In 1944, Maurice Hilleman of Squibb Pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against Japanese encephelitis. Hilleman would later move to Merck where he would play a key role in the development of vaccines against measles, mumps, chickenpox, rubella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and meningitis.", "users": [{"userType": "Human", "id": "Bob"}, {"userType": "Human", "id": "Alice"}], "evaluation": [{"breadth": 4, "userId": "Bob", "quality": 4, "engagement": 4}, {"breadth": 5, "userId": "Alice", "quality": 5, "engagement": 5}], "thread": [{"evaluation": 2, "text": "hi", "userId": "Bob", "NP": [], "UTT_LEN": 1, "UTT": ["hi"], "NLL": NaN}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "hi, I think, vaccines are impotant stuff", "userId": "Alice", "NP": ["vaccines", "I", "impotant stuff"], "UTT_LEN": 9, "UTT": ["hi", ",", "I", "think", ",", "vaccines", "are", "impotant", "stuff"], "NLL": 240.01340376731903}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "oh, for sure. they saved a millions of life", "userId": "Bob", "NP": ["they", "life", "a millions", "a millions of life"], "UTT_LEN": 11, "UTT": ["oh", ",", "for", "sure", ".", "they", "saved", "a", "millions", "of", "life"], "NLL": 284.85503452869426}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "all of us after born getting a vaccine", "userId": "Alice", "NP": ["us", "all", "all of us", "a vaccine"], "UTT_LEN": 8, "UTT": ["all", "of", "us", "after", "born", "getting", "a", "vaccine"], "NLL": 811.4799599832803}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "without right to decline this", "userId": "Alice", "NP": ["this"], "UTT_LEN": 5, "UTT": ["without", "right", "to", "decline", "this"], "NLL": 221.73364406969623}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "do you know smthn about antiobiotic resistence bacteria are produced?", "userId": "Bob", "NP": ["you", "antiobiotic resistence bacteria", "smthn"], "UTT_LEN": 11, "UTT": ["do", "you", "know", "smthn", "about", "antiobiotic", "resistence", "bacteria", "are", "produced", "?"], "NLL": 614.299818268785}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "on;y heard, they developpeng a resistence and can adopt to new antibiotics.

Building on the successful sale of sheriff appointments in 1194, John initiated a new round of appointments, with the new incumbents making back their investment through increased fines and penalties, particularly in the forests. Another innovation of Richard's, increased charges levied on widows who wished to remain single, was expanded under John. John continued to sell charters for new towns, including the planned town of Liverpool, and charters were sold for markets across the kingdom and in Gascony.[nb 11] The king introduced new taxes and extended existing ones.

In 999, large portions of Iran came briefly under the rule of the Ghaznavids, whose rulers were of mamluk Turk origin, and longer subsequently under the Turkish Seljuk and Khwarezmian empires. These Turks had been Persianized and had adopted Persian models of administration and rulership. The Seljuks subsequently gave rise to the Sultanate of Rum in Anatolia, while taking their thoroughly Persianized identity with them.

In order to radiate 100 W of power, one would need to use a transmitter capable of supplying 125 W to the antenna. Note that antenna efficiency is a separate issue from impedance matching, which may also reduce the amount of power radiated using a given transmitter. If an SWR meter reads 150 W of incident power and 50 W of reflected power, that means that 100 W have actually been absorbed by the antenna (ignoring transmission line losses). How much of that power has actually been radiated cannot be directly determined through electrical measurements at (or before) the antenna terminals, but would require (for instance) careful measurement of field strength.

The relative size of each element in the mix plays a primary role in determining which mechanism will occur. When the atoms are relatively similar in size, the atom exchange method usually happens, where some of the atoms composing the metallic crystals are substituted with atoms of the other constituent. This is called a substitutional alloy. Examples of substitutional alloys include bronze and brass, in which some of the copper atoms are substituted with either tin or zinc atoms. With the interstitial mechanism, one atom is usually much smaller than the other, so cannot successfully replace an atom in the crystals of the base metal. The smaller atoms become trapped in the spaces between the atoms in the crystal matrix, called the interstices. This is referred to as an interstitial alloy. Steel is an example of an interstitial alloy, because the very small carbon atoms fit into interstices of the iron matrix. Stainless steel is an example of a combination of interstitial and substitutional alloys, because the carbon atoms fit into the interstices, but some of the iron atoms are replaced with nickel and chromium atoms.", "users": [{"userType": "Human", "id": "Alice"}, {"userType": "Human", "id": "Bob"}], "evaluation": [{"breadth": 5, "userId": "Alice", "quality": 5, "engagement": 5}, {"breadth": 5, "userId": "Bob", "quality": 5, "engagement": 5}], "thread": [{"evaluation": 2, "text": "Fascinating!", "userId": "Bob", "time": 320000000, "NP": [], "UTT_LEN": 2, "UTT": ["Fascinating", "!"], "NLL": 128.6611270570889}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "Are you into physics?", "userId": "Alice", "time": 320000000, "NP": ["you", "physics"], "UTT_LEN": 5, "UTT": ["Are", "you", "into", "physics", "?"], "NLL": 123.74027996172703}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "Yeah!

St. John's experiences milder temperatures during the winter season in comparison to other Canadian cities, and has the mildest winter for any Canadian city outside of British Columbia. Precipitation is frequent and often heavy, falling year round. On average, summer is the driest season, with only occasional thunderstorm activity, and the wettest months are from October to January, with December the wettest single month, with nearly 165 millimetres of precipitation on average. This winter precipitation maximum is quite unusual for humid continental climates, which most commonly have a late spring or early summer precipitation maximum (for example, most of the Midwestern U.S.). Most heavy precipitation events in St. John's are the product of intense mid-latitude storms migrating from the Northeastern U.S. and New England states, and these are most common and intense from October to March, bringing heavy precipitation (commonly 4 to 8 centimetres of rainfall equivalent in a single storm), and strong winds. In winter, two or more types of precipitation (rain, freezing rain, sleet and snow) can fall from passage of a single storm. Snowfall is heavy, averaging nearly 335 centimetres per winter season. However, winter storms can bring changing precipitation types. Heavy snow can transition to heavy rain, melting the snow cover, and possibly back to snow or ice (perhaps briefly) all in the same storm, resulting in little or no net snow accumulation. Snow cover in St. John's is variable, and especially early in the winter season, may be slow to develop, but can extend deeply into the spring months (March, April). The St. John's area is subject to freezing rain (called \"silver thaws\"), the worst of which paralyzed the city over a three-day period in April 1984.", "users": [{"userType": "Human", "id": "Bob"},

doctrine of the last day and eschatology (the final fate of the universe) may be reckoned as the second great doctrine of the Quran.

There is a reference to the afterlife on most pages of the Quran and belief in the afterlife is often referred to in conjunction with belief in God as in the common expression: \"Believe in God and the last day\". A number of suras such as 44, 56, 75, 78, 81 and 101 are directly related to the afterlife and its preparations. Some suras indicate the closeness of the event and warn people to be prepared for the imminent day. For instance, the first verses of Sura 22, which deal with the mighty earthquake and the situations of people on that day, represent this style of divine address: \"O People!

including John's recent biographers Ralph Turner and Lewis Warren, argue that John was an unsuccessful monarch, but note that his failings were exaggerated by 12th- and 13th-century chroniclers. Jim Bradbury notes the current consensus that John was a \"hard-working administrator, an able man, an able general\", albeit, as Turner suggests, with \"distasteful, even dangerous personality traits\", including pettiness, spitefulness and cruelty. John Gillingham, author of a major biography of Richard I, follows this line too, although he considers John a less effective general than do Turner or Warren, and describes him \"one of the worst kings ever to rule England\". Bradbury takes a moderate line, but suggests that in recent years modern historians have been overly lenient towards John's numerous faults.

Firewalls are common amongst machines that are permanently connected to the Internet.", "users": [{"userType": "Human", "id": "Bob"}, {"userType": "Human", "id": "Alice"}], "evaluation": [{"breadth": 3, "userId": "Bob", "quality": 4, "engagement": 2}, {"breadth": 1, "userId": "Alice", "quality": 1, "engagement": 1}], "thread": [{"evaluation": 0, "text": "hello there", "userId": "Alice", "time": 750000000, "NP": [], "UTT_LEN": 2, "UTT": ["hello", "there"], "NLL": 818.3902383195127}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "Hi", "userId": "Bob", "time": 750000000, "NP": [], "UTT_LEN": 1, "UTT": ["Hi"], "NLL": NaN}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "Do you tend to be paranoid when it comes to your cyber-security?", "userId": "Alice", "time": 750000000, "NP": ["it", "you", "your cyber-security"], "UTT_LEN": 15, "UTT": ["Do", "you", "tend", "to", "be", "paranoid", "when", "it", "comes", "to", "your", "cyber", "-", "security", "?"], "NLL": 20.921621942118538}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "Yes, I'm a very paranoid", "userId": "Bob", "time": 750000000, "NP": ["I"], "UTT_LEN": 8, "UTT": ["Yes", ",", "I", "'", "m", "a", "very", "paranoid"], "NLL": 33.880683029279965}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "What measures do you take to protect yourself in the Internet?", "userId": "Alice", "time": 750000000, "NP": ["yourself", "What measures", "you", "the Internet"], "UTT_LEN": 12, "UTT": ["What", "measures", "do", "you", "take", "to", "protect", "yourself", "in", "the", "Internet", "?"], "NLL": 36.136240273760365}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "Are you still there?", "userId": "Alice", "time": 750000000, "NP": ["you"], "UTT_LEN": 5, "UTT": ["Are", "you", "still", "there", "?"], "NLL": 29.686580095628305}, {"evaluation": 0, "text": "nah", "userId": "Alice", "time": 750000000, "NP": [], "UTT_LEN": 1, "UTT": ["nah"], "NLL": NaN}], "dialogId": -1097947177}, {"context": "On 23 October 1501, at Mielnik Polish\u2013Lithuanian union was reformed at the Union of Mielnik (Polish: unia mielnicka, unia piotrkowsko-mielnicka).

It is the capital city of Jiangsu province of People's Republic of China and the second largest city in East China, with a total population of 8,216,100, and legally the capital of Republic of China which lost the mainland during the civil war. The city whose name means \"Southern Capital\" has a prominent place in Chinese history and culture, having served as the capitals of various Chinese dynasties, kingdoms and republican governments dating from the 3rd century AD to 1949. Prior to the advent of pinyin romanization, Nanjing's city name was spelled as Nanking or Nankin. Nanjing has a number of other names, and some historical names are now used as names of districts of the city, and among them there is the name Jiangning (\u6c5f\u5be7), whose former character Jiang (\u6c5f, River) is the former part of the name Jiangsu and latter character Ning (\u5be7, simplified form \u5b81, Peace) is the short name of Nanjing. When being the capital of a state, for instance, ROC, Jing (\u4eac) is adopted as the abbreviation of Nanjing. Although as a city located in southern part of China becoming Chinese national capital as early as in Jin dynasty, the name Nanjing was designated to the city in Ming dynasty, about a thousand years later.

lights for cars' high-mounted brake lights, trucks, and buses, and in turn signals for some time, but many vehicles now use LEDs for their rear light clusters. The use in brakes improves safety, due to a great reduction in the time needed to light fully, or faster rise time, up to 0.5 second faster[citation needed] than an incandescent bulb. This gives drivers behind more time to react. In a dual intensity circuit (rear markers and brakes) if the LEDs are not pulsed at a fast enough frequency, they can create a phantom array, where ghost images of the LED will appear if the eyes quickly scan across the array. White LED headlamps are starting to be used.

One of Albert's dressing gowns was placed by her side, with a plaster cast of his hand, while a lock of John Brown's hair, along with a picture of him, was placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers.

The Seleucid Antiochus III had allied with Philip V of Macedon in 203 BC, agreeing that they should jointly conquer the lands of the boy-king of Egypt, Ptolemy V. After defeating Ptolemy in the Fifth Syrian War, Antiochus concentrated on occupying the Ptolemaic possessions in Asia Minor. However, this brought Antiochus into conflict with Rhodes and Pergamum, two important Roman allies, and began a 'cold war' between Rome and Antiochus (not helped by the presence of Hannibal at the Seleucid court). Meanwhile, in mainland Greece, the Aetolian League, which had sided with Rome against Macedon, now grew to resent the Roman presence in Greece. This presented Antiochus III with a pretext to invade Greece and 'liberate' it from Roman influence, thus starting the Roman-Syrian War (192\u2013188 BC). In 191 BC, the Romans under Manius Acilius Glabrio routed him at Thermopylae and obliged him to withdraw to Asia. During the course of this war Roman troops moved into Asia for the first time, where they defeated Antiochus again at the Battle of Magnesia (190 BC). A crippling treaty was imposed on Antiochus, with Seleucid possessions in Asia Minor removed and given to Rhodes and Pergamum, the size of the Seleucid navy reduced, and a massive war indemnity invoked.", "users": [{"userType": "Human", "id": "Bob"}, {"userType": "Human", "id": "Alice"}], "evaluation": [{"breadth": 5, "userId": "Alice", "quality": 5, "engagement": 5}, {"breadth": 5, "userId": "Bob", "quality": 5, "engagement": 5}], "thread": [{"evaluation": 2, "text": "Who are Romans?", "userId": "Alice", "time": 568000000, "NP": ["Romans", "Who"], "UTT_LEN": 4, "UTT": ["Who", "are", "Romans", "?"], "NLL": 424.15234593340085}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "Well, is it such a difficult question?", "userId": "Alice", "time": 568000000, "NP": ["it", "such a difficult question"], "UTT_LEN": 9, "UTT": ["Well", ",", "is", "it", "such", "a", "difficult", "question", "?"], "NLL": 31.236244506038958}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "Romans where the inhabitants of the Roman empire.", "userId": "Bob", "time": 568000000, "NP": ["the Roman empire", "Romans", "Romans where the inhabitants of the Roman empire."], "UTT_LEN": 9, "UTT": ["Romans", "where", "the", "inhabitants", "of", "the", "Roman", "empire", "."], "NLL": 123.15927912105349}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "Not at all.", "userId": "Bob", "time": 568000000, "NP": [], "UTT_LEN": 4, "UTT": ["Not", "at", "all", "."], "NLL": 9.459549634193449}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "What do you think about Romans' wars?", "userId": "Alice", "time": 568000000, "NP": ["Romans' wars", "you", "What"], "UTT_LEN": 9, "UTT": ["What", "do", "you", "think", "about", "Romans", "'", "wars", "?"], "NLL": 62.66150399754317}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "They fought many, and they certainly won many.", "userId": "Bob", "time": 568000000, "NP": ["they", "They"], "UTT_LEN": 10, "UTT": ["They", "fought", "many", ",", "and", "they", "certainly", "won", "many", "."], "NLL": 85.94083184051868}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "Were they fair with seizued nations?", "userId": "Alice", "time": 568000000, "NP": ["they", "seizued nations"], "UTT_LEN": 7, "UTT": ["Were", "they", "fair", "with", "seizued", "nations", "?"], "NLL": 5940.221863341946}, {"evaluation": 1, "text": "I have no idea.", "userId": "Bob", "time": 568000000, "NP": ["I", "no idea"], "UTT_LEN": 5, "UTT": ["I", "have", "no", "idea", "."], "NLL": 19.010606727509924}, {"evaluation": 2, "text": "I think, that they are overrated civilization.

The Parian Chronicle says that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Greeks (\u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of Hellenes, was son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, who ruled around Phthia, the only survivors after the great deluge. It seems that the myth was invented when the Greek tribes started to separate from each other in certain areas of Greece and it indicates their common origin. Aristotle names ancient Hellas as an area in Epirus between Dodona and the Achelous river, the location of the great deluge of Deucalion, a land occupied by the Selloi and the \"Greeks\" who later came to be known as \"Hellenes\". Selloi were the priests of Dodonian Zeus and the word probably means \"sacrificers\" (compare Gothic saljan, \"present, sacrifice\"). There is currently no satisfactory etymology of the name Hellenes. Some scholars assert that the name Selloi changed to Sellanes and then to Hellanes-Hellenes. However this etymology connects the name Hellenes with the Dorians who occupied Epirus and the relation with the name Greeks given by the Romans becomes uncertain. The name Hellenes seems to be older and it was probably used by the Greeks with the establishment of the Great Amphictyonic League. This was an ancient association of Greek tribes with twelve founders which was organized to protect the great temples of Apollo in Delphi (Phocis) and of Demeter near Thermopylae (Locris).

The term \"government\" would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound. This conceptual distinction continues to operate in political science, although some political scientists, philosophers, historians and cultural anthropologists have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state, and that there are societies that are not organized into states that nevertheless must be considered in political terms. As long as the concept of natural order was not introduced, the social sciences could not evolve independently of theistic thinking.

Many local Carnival customs are claimed to derive from local pre-Christian rituals, such as elaborate rites involving masked figures in the Swabian\u2013Alemannic Fastnacht. However, evidence is insufficient to establish a direct origin from Saturnalia or other ancient festivals. No complete accounts of Saturnalia survive and the shared features of feasting, role reversals, temporary social equality, masks and permitted rule-breaking do not necessarily constitute a coherent festival or link these festivals. These similarities may represent a reservoir of cultural resources that can embody multiple meanings and functions. For example, Easter begins with the resurrection of Jesus, followed by a liminal period and ends with rebirth. Carnival reverses this as King Carnival comes to life, a liminal period follows before his death. Both feasts are calculated by the lunar calendar. Both Jesus and King Carnival may be seen as expiatory figures who make a gift to the people with their deaths. In the case of Jesus, the gift is eternal life in heaven and in the case of King Carnival, the acknowledgement that death is a necessary part of the cycle of life. Besides Christian anti-Judaism, the commonalities between church and Carnival rituals and imagery suggest a common root. Christ's passion is itself grotesque: Since early Christianity Christ is figured as the victim of summary judgement, is tortured and executed by Romans before a Jewish mob (\"His blood is on us and on our children!\" Matthew 27:24\u201325). Holy Week processions in Spain include crowds who vociferously insult the figure of Jesus. Irreverence, parody, degradation and laughter at a tragicomic effigy God can be seen as intensifications of the sacred order. In 1466, the Catholic Church under Pope Paul II revieved customs of the Saturnalia carnival: Jews were forced to race naked through the streets of the city of Rome. \u201cBefore they were to run, the Jews were richly fed, so as to make the race more difficult for them and at the same time more amusing for spectators.

Napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of the Allies, but then ordered his forces to retreat so that he could feign a grave weakness. Desperate to lure the Allies into battle, Napoleon gave every indication in the days preceding the engagement that the French army was in a pitiful state, even abandoning the dominant Pratzen Heights near the village of Austerlitz. At the Battle of Austerlitz, in Moravia on 2 December, he deployed the French army below the Pratzen Heights and deliberately weakened his right flank, enticing the Allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole French line. A forced march from Vienna by Marshal Davout and his III Corps plugged the gap left by Napoleon just in time. Meanwhile, the heavy Allied deployment against the French right weakened their center on the Pratzen Heights, which was viciously attacked by the IV Corps of Marshal Soult. With the Allied center demolished, the French swept through both enemy flanks and sent the Allies fleeing chaotically, capturing thousands of prisoners in the process.
